The name is "One Cut Checker".
Without editing GameObject or Scene, you can rewind the game from the editor or loop one cut.

As other functions, pause and next frame often used during operation check are registered as shortcut keys.

These are also registered with the Unity standard, but for example it was necessary to enter "Ctrl + Shift + P" to pause.
In one hand the majority of people are holding the mouse, so it is very hard to enter it with the other hand.

So, "One Cut Checker" makes it possible to enter with 1 key.
